24h Watchface on the Basis of Android Wear watch face codelab
=============================================================

A 24h watchface for my needs (Huawei Watch 2).  Codelab see https://watchface-codelab.appspot.com

Features
--------
   * 24h watch with 24:00h at top - no minute hand, 24h "hand" as dot
   * Dark mode with minimized light emission (dimming controlled by light sensor of the watch)
   * Light mode with extra big numbers (hour-number filled relative to minutes in hour passed)
   * Switch between dark and light mode by tabbing on the top (with "button")
   * Minimal mode with no numbers (date or time; except number of steps per day), minimal status & notifications (status at top if only one status info, else "+" for more)
   * Turn minimal mode on/off by tabbing the middle (no "button" shown)
   * Display of next alarm and calendar events (18h in future)
   * Display title of next calendar event 50 minutes before event
   * Display of time to and time during calendar events (50 minutes before)
   * Display of ISO date and german day
   * Toggling display by 180Â° by tabbing the right
   * Toggling minutes, date and meeting title display by tabbing the bottom
   * Display of status information at the top of the watch face (if more than one info):  W: Wifi enabled -- !: Unread notifications -- i: Active notifications -- <: Not silenced -- >: Flight mode  -- X: No internet connection -- âŒ–: GPS enabled
   * Remaining time on countdown timer on top (works cleanly for timers of less than ten hours)
   * Turn on/off numbers of watch by tabbing right (numbers as buttons), numbers are never shown in dark mode)
   * Battery fill is shown as black dot in the hour hand if battery < 37% 
   * Color-changes according to hour
   * Upcoming meetings in the next 50 minutes are shown either as black (on color) or color (on black) lines in the bit hour numbers (when they are displayed)
   
Next ideas
--------
   * Why does the watchface restart occasionally? --> no reports found in log
   * Use "ðŸ”† Bright Button" and "ðŸ”… Dim Button" instead of sun in the UI
   * Show calendar events only if they have a notification or if status is "busy"
   * Reserve the 24h space for notifications (move dot to 12h / bottom)  
   * Handle display state and style in separate class
